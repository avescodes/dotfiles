This directory contains some files which are not part of Tramp but
are used by it.  Often, you don't need these files at all, because
your Emacs otherwise provides the necessary functionality.

base64.el
        The functionality is part of the Emacs C core since Emacs
        20.5 or so.  You can decide if you need it by typing `ESC :'
        and then entering the following command:
                (require 'base64)
        If Emacs prints "base64" in the echo area, you have the
        functionality and do not need the file.
        If Emacs prints an error message about being unable to open
        the file, then you need it.

format-spec.el
        This file is originally from Gnus.  So if your Emacs contains
        a sufficiently recent Gnus, you do not need this.  You can
        use the same check as above for finding out if you need it.

uudecode.el
        This file is also from Gnus, and it does what the name says :-)
        See above for more information.

md5.el
        This is an implementation of the MD5 algorithm in Lisp.  If
        your Emacs does not have a built-in version, you can use this
        file.

password.el
        An implementation of password caching, which has appeared
        first time in Gnus.  Tramp doesn't need it mandatory, it could
        live without.  Same check as with the other files.

run-at-time.el
        This file is used by password.el for XEmacs.  Also from Gnus.

socks.el
        An implementation of socks 5 server.  Taken from the w3 package.
