When you're working on something important you might want to delay
responding to incoming messages.  However, when you're done working,
will you remember them?  If you're anything like me, you'll have a lot
of buffers in your Emacs session, and a jabber chat buffer can easily
get lost.

   <p>When you type <kbd>M-x jabber-activity-mode</kbd> Emacs starts keeping
track of the buddies which have messaged you since last you visited
their buffer, and will display them in mode line.  As soon as you
visit their buffer they disappear from the mode line, indicating that
you've read their message.

   <p>If your mode line fills over because of these notifications, you can
customize <code>jabber-activity-make-strings</code> to shorten them to the
shortest possibly unambiguous form.

   <p>If you try to exit Emacs while you still have unread messages, you
will be notified and asked about this.  If you don't like that, set
<code>jabber-activity-query-unread</code> to nil.

   <p>If you want to display the number of unread buffers in the frame title,
set <code>jabber-activity-count-in-title</code> to t.  The format of the
number can be changed through
<code>jabber-activity-count-in-title-format</code>.

   <p>For complete customizability, write a hook function for
<code>jabber-activity-update-hook</code>.  From that function, you can take
action based on <code>jabber-activity-jids</code>,
<code>jabber-activity-mode-string</code>, and
<code>jabber-activity-count-string</code>.
