;;
;; Attachments are managed in a special directory called "data", which
;; lives in the directory given by `org-directory'.  If this data
;; directory is initialized as a Git repository, then org-attach will
;; automatically commit changes when it sees them.
;;
;; Attachment directories are identified using a UUID generated for the
;; task which has the attachments.  These are added as property to the
;; task when necessary, and should not be deleted or changed by the
;; user, ever.  UUIDs are generated by a mechanism defined in the variable
;; `org-id-method'.
